# Conclusion

This workshop only covered three tools for UI regression testing. There are many more out there; check out the [http://csste.st tools page](http://csste.st/tools/) for a much more complete list.

[A simple Google search for `CSS regression testing`](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=css+regression+testing) will bring up a wealth of articles and tools to help you along your way.

The right tool for the job will depend greatly on your specific needs. Are you working on a large website or a small one? Is there a lot of JavaScript interactivity, or is the site mostly static? Think about these things, and how the tool your looking at handles them, before committing to a specific toolset. But don't be afraid to just try something out and see if it's worth it.

There's a lot of room for growth in this are and contributors are needed to advance the industry away from endless, mindless manual visual regression testing. Find something that fits your needs and start contributing back!
