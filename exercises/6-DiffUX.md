# Project workflows with DiffUX

Almost all of us work on teams at some point in time. Having a good workflow is crucial to keeping production going.

DiffUX provides a way to create an approval process for style changes. For example, if you have another developer making a small style tweak to the site, you can approve or reject the difference from DiffUX.

## Goal

Understand how UI regression testing can work as part of a project workflow.

## Exercise

1. If you haven't already, start the local node server with `node index.js`
2. Start the DiffUX server (take each action in a separate command line window/tab)
 - Start redis - `redis-server`
 - Start the Ruby server - `bundle exec rails s`
 - Start sidekiq - `bundle exec sidekiq`
3. In a browser, open up DiffUX at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. Click the 'Add New Project' button
 - Name it
 - Leave dimensions as is
 - Add in URLs for the pages
 - Create the project
5. Start a sweep
6. Grab something to drink while the sweep runs
7. After the sweep has been completed, validate all images are as expected and accept them

### Part 2 - Validating Changes

1. In the theme styles, change the default color of 'strong' tags to be `#036`
2. Trigger a second sweep with your changes
3. After the sweep completes, see if DiffUX caught your changes.
 - Notice how DiffUX automatically approves any pages without changes on them
 - Where there any unwanted color changes? (Hint: the alert box colors shouldn't have changed)

## Extra Credit

DiffUX allows you to [trigger sweeps via an API call](https://github.com/diffux/diffux#triggering-sweeps), allowing you to integrate sweeps with a tool like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) or [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) (or even [git hooks](http://githooks.com/)). You can also make this call via the command line. Using the command line, or a tool like [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/), trigger a sweep of the site.
