UI Regression Workshop
============

The five exercises outlined in this repo are aimed at providing an introduction to UI regression testing. They're designed to provide a partially real-world codebase from which to demo three tools: Wraith, PhantomCSS and DiffUX.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local dev environment
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Get started with [the first exercise](./exercises/1-Wraith.md)

## You will need

- Ruby. I reccommend [RVM](http://rvm.io/) or [RBENV](http://rbenv.org/) to easily install Ruby. A Ruby version of ruby-2.0.0-p247 or higher is required.
- Node. I recommend using [NVM for Node](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/). Install via Homebrew: `brew install phantomjs`
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/). Install via Homebrew: `brew install imagemagick`
- [Wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith/#installation)
- [CasperJS 1.1 Beta](http://docs.casperjs.org/en/latest/installation.html) Install via Homebrew `brew install casperjs`
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
- [PhantomCSS](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS) `npm install phantomcss`
- [DiffUX](https://github.com/diffux/diffux#mac-os-x-using-homebrew)

## Technical Skills Required

- Basic understanding of the command line
- Intermediate understanding of CSS/SASS
- Intermediate understanding of JavaScript

### Having Installation Troubles?

### PG gem install issues?

Check out [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19262312/installing-pg-gem-failure-to-build-native-extension/19620569#19620569).

#### Alternatives

Sometimes we customize our machines a little too much, or end up with an out of date dependency that just won't upgrade, causing installation frustration and dependency nightmares. If you're faced with a situation like this, here are a couple alternative ways to get things set up:

- Use [Cloud9IDE](http://c9.io), clone this repo and install the tools via its command line.
- Work off of a virtual machine using a tool like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

# Contributions are Welcome!

While I've put a lot of effort trying to polish everything up, there will inevitably be mistakes or things that could be explained more clearly. I would love any help I can get to clean things up.

Also, if you see a tool that isn't covered here, feel free to open it up as an issue or, even better, submit a pull request!

# Re-Use Welcome
